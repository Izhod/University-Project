# University-Project
My project from my university on C++

This is a simple program for processing students. 
There are functions for:

- Adding a new student;
- Removing a student;
- Sorting students alphabetically;
- Printing out the maximum and the minimum grad;
- Printing out the average grade of all students;
- Dividing the failed and successful students in a new list;
- Printing out the list with all the students;
- Exiting the program.

PrintVector() actually prints a list because there were two versions of this program - one with a vector and one with a list

TODO:
- Exception handling
